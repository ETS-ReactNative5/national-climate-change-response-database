      'The platform is developed and managed by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) to facilitate the monitoring and tracking of national, provincial and local responses to climate change.\nAs outlined in both the National Development Plan (NDP) and National Climate Change Response Policy (2011), South Africa has committed to a just transition to a low carbon economy and climate-resilient society. The country is projected to face a higher frequency of climate-related disasters that are increasing in intensity, and these events are likely to be associated with impacts that are on par with, if not worse than those already experienced.\nThe National Climate Change Response Database (NCCRD) is intended as a resource to collect and track interventions on climate change (adaptation and mitigation) on past, current and future climate change response efforts (policies, plans, strategies, projects and research) across South Africa.',
